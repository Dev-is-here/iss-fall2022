# CSP305 Research Project Implementation

### Research Paper - A reversible and affine invariant 3D data hiding technique based on difference shifting and logistic map

Paper can be accessed here - [Link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-019-01179-4)


A code reporsitory is divided in three parts : 

#### I. Python Notebook - has to be run on Google Colab - [access here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Eh4-Z0Jcv4yEnhjtXa78-dYfrutk-4o?usp=sharing)

This only contains the algorithms discussed in paper implemented in [Python Language](https://www.python.org/)


#### II. Data 

This directory contains the following files that are been used in the implementation.

* bun_zipper.ply - 3D Image of a bunny (rabit)


#### III. Web App

On opening the ```index.html``` in the browser, we can access an web application that demonstrates the ***Logistc Map***, ***Encryption*** and ***Decryption*** on the file
